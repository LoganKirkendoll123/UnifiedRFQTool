## üöÄ Overview

FreightIQ Pro is an enterprise-grade freight quoting platform that provides automated, intelligent routing across multiple carrier networks. The platform uses smart classification to automatically route shipments to the optimal network:

- **FreshX Network**: For temperature-controlled reefer shipments
- **Project44 LTL**: For standard less-than-truckload shipments
- **Project44 VLTL**: For volume less-than-truckload shipments

## ‚ú® Key Features

## üîß API Configuration

### Project44 OAuth2 Setup

```javascript
// Required credentials
{
  clientId: "your-project44-client-id",
  clientSecret: "your-project44-client-secret"
}
```

### FreshX API Setup

```javascript
// Required for reefer shipments
{
  apiKey: "your-freshx-api-key"
}
```

## üìä Smart Routing Logic

### Classification Rules

| Condition | isReefer | Pallets | Weight | Routing Decision |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|------------------|
| Reefer Shipment | `TRUE` | Any | Any | FreshX Reefer Network |
| Standard LTL | `FALSE` | 1-9 | < 15,000 lbs | Project44 Standard LTL |
| Volume LTL | `FALSE` | 10+ OR | 15,000+ lbs | Project44 Dual Mode (VLTL + LTL) |

### Multi-Mode Benefits

For Volume LTL shipments, the system automatically:
- Gets quotes from both Volume LTL and Standard LTL networks
- Compares pricing and service levels side-by-side
- Highlights the best option with savings calculations
- Provides detailed competitive analysis
