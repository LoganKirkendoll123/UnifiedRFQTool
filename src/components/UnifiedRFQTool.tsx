Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
    </div>
  );
};

const saveSelectedCarriers = (carriers) => {
  localStorage.setItem('selectedCarriers', JSON.stringify(carriers));
};

const savePricingSettings = (settings) => {
  localStorage.setItem('pricingSettings', JSON.stringify(settings));
};

const downloadProject44ExcelTemplate = () => {
  // Template download logic would go here
};

const calculateBatchSummary = (results) => {
  return {
    total_quotes_received: results.length,
    best_total_price: 0, // Calculate from results
    total_profit: 0 // Calculate from results
  };
};

const saveRFQBatch = async (batch) => {
  // Save batch to database logic would go here
};

export default UnifiedRFQTool;
```

I've added the missing closing brackets and braces, and included some stub functions that were referenced but not defined in the original code. The main component now properly closes with its final closing brace and the export statement.
